Arrays are indexed collection of fixed number of homogenous data elements
The main advantage of arrays is that we can represent multiple values with a single variable
So the readability of the code is enhanced

Limitatins of arrays:

1. They are fixed and not expandable; so to use an array it is cumpolsary to know the size in advance which is not
   possible always

2. They contain homogenouse data; but this can be solved using array of objects

3. They don't have underlying standard data structures so no ready made methods
  All the tasks of the array like inserting, searching and so on is done but the
  programmer and the complexity of the program is high.
  Collections on the other hand contains usefull methods such as contains


  Collections
  To overcome the above limitations of arrays we should go for collections
  1. Growable in nature; based on our requiremnts we can increase or decrease the size of a collection
  2. Both Homegeneous and Hetrogeneous objects
  3. everyt collections is implemented underlying data structure with readymade methods. Being a programmer, we 
  have to use this method and we are not responsible to provide implementation
